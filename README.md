# High Fidelity Bow and Arrow Rework

Creates a bow and arrow for use in High Fidelity. Based off the bow in High Fidelity's [Shortbow tutorial](https://wiki.highfidelity.com/wiki/Shortbow_Tutorial) by James B. Pollack. Revised to use proper archery terminology, remove dead code, and add comments to improve clarity for the exercise.
